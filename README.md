# SQL Analysis - Hewlett-Packard  

## Background

I reviewed data sets on employees who worked at Hewlett-Packard from the 1980s and 1990s . There were six different CSV files that I imported into SQL so that I could create tables in Postgres. After that was completed, I then manipulated the data by writing out various SQL queries which will be displayed below. 

### Steps 

#### Create ERD Diagram

I inspected the CSV files and sketched out an ERD diagram before I uploaded the CSV files into Postgres SQL.

#### Import CSV Files into SQL

* I imported all six CSV files into SQL. Once that was completed, I created tables which included primary and foreign keys.
